### Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0

1. **Update Python version**
   ```bash
   # Ensure Python 3.12 is installed
   python --version  # Should show 3.12.x
   ```

2. **Update dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run new linting tools**
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   ruff format .
   mypy main.py --strict
   ```

4. **Update Railway environment**
   - No changes required - same environment variables
   - Health check endpoint improved: `/health`

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
   ```

### Breaking Changes

- **Python 3.12 Required**: Minimum Python version is now 3.12
- **Type Annotations**: All functions now require proper type hints
- **Import Changes**: Some internal imports may have changed
- **Configuration**: Tool configuration moved to `pyproject.toml`

### Deprecations

- **Old linting tools**: Black and isort replaced by Ruff
- **Manual testing**: Replaced by automated pytest suite
